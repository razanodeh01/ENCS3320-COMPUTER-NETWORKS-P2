<h2>Network simulation and visualization.</h2>
<p>*****************************************************************</p>
<p>In this completed project, I tackled two main components. Firstly, using Wireshark, I delved into DHCP, DNS, and ICMP packets, examining series for each service. I picked one packet from each and explained at least five fields. Secondly, in Cisco Packet Tracer, I set up a network with four routers, two switches, five PCs, a web server, and a DNS server. The network used OSPF, had DHCP in one subnet, and assigned IP addresses based on university IDs with proper subnetting. I tested connectivity with ping commands and traced packet paths from subnet hosts to a remote destination using the tracert command. This project provided me with a hands-on experience, combining theory and practical networking skills.
